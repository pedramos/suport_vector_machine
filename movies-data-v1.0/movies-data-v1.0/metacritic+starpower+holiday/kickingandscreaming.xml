         <snippet>Ferrell's ideally suited to man-boy characters, and that's what Phil Weston is in "Kicking."</snippet>

         <snippet>Some scenes are just silly, others are dead-on uproarious. Ditka, a real-life football legend, is a real find as our hero's assistant.</snippet>

         <snippet>An entertaining family movie, and may serve a useful purpose if it inspires kids to overthrow their coaches and take over their own sports.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's all kept light and funny, but underlying the broad sight gags is a movie that actually has something to say about competition, fathers and sons, machismo and caffeine.</snippet>

         <snippet>Laughs-wise, it lacks the raucous edge of an "Old School" or "Anchorman" or the retro charm of an "Elf," but there's still plenty of Will-power to fuel this likable underdog trifle. It certainly is more enjoyable than a lot of what passes for family entertainment these days.</snippet>

         <snippet>An immensely likable, funny comedy that finds a novel approach to that familiar combo of kids and sports.</snippet>

         <snippet>This might be the most predictable movie of the year, but at least it delivers everything you expect it to.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kicking &amp; Screaming may be a prefab cartoon out of the "Bad News Bears" cookie cutter, but Ferrell doesn't just save this junk -- he rules it.</snippet>

         <snippet>For soccer aficionados, Kicking &amp; Screaming boasts some fairly cool play, courtesy of Alessandro Ruggiero and Francesco Liotti, two kids who play "the Italians."</snippet>

         <snippet>It's Ferrell who is the vehicle, a mow-you-down comic engine, and everyone else is just along for the ride in this marginally effective, starkly unoriginal family comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>R0bert Duvall as a pee wee soccer coach? Great idea, but Kicking and Screaming should have had him roar, "I love the smell of juice boxes in the morning."</snippet>

         <snippet>There aren't any big laughs, but there's a steady supply of small ones, and with his overgrown-kid persona Ferrell seems more comfortable in a family comedy than, say, Eddie Murphy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Luckily for the viewer, Ferrell is an irresistible presence. His occasional moments of unwarranted weirdness are the only thing that makes this otherwise pedestrian movie bearable (let alone interesting) to watch.</snippet>

         <snippet>Relatively harmless fun, although it does make you wish Ferrell would do more risky, rule-bending work like "Anchorman." Enough with the generic star vehicles man, write thee a screenplay again!</snippet>

         <snippet>Not only not funny, it's unfunny. It kills humor. Sit in a room by yourself, look at a blank screen for 90 minutes, and you'll have more of a chance of laughing at your own thoughts than you will at this movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>If its made-for-TV sensibility explains its chaotically blobby shooting style, it doesn't clarify a plot so painfully padded that it looks for laughs in strange digressive asides regarding bratwurst and coffee.</snippet>
