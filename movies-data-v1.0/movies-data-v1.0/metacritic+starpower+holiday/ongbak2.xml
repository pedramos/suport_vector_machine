         <snippet>The astonishingly gonzoid fight scenes from Ong Bak 2 might be the best ever filmed.</snippet>

         <snippet>Oddly enough, it's when the action of Ong Bak 2 stops that this funkadelic freakshow shines. The screen is stuffed with a gallery of grotesques, some of Thailand's best character actors, who spend their time bleeding, bellowing, and slurping up eyeballs.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jaa, mesmerizing as ever to behold with his pinwheel moves, also (co)directs for the first time.</snippet>

         <snippet>What sold the original Ong Bak was the action, not the story, and on an action level, Ong Bak 2 lives up to its title.</snippet>

         <snippet>A must-see for genre fans. Jaa in action is poetry - even in a disappointing film. Let's just hope he regains his senses for Ong Bak 3.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jaa’s period ‘beatquel’ is thick on action but thin on plot. Awesome final fight, though.</snippet>

         <snippet>The new film sometimes feels too snazzy in its jittery cinematography, but the stunts make it through the budget upgrade intact.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jaa's performance as Tien is mostly wordless and humorless.</snippet>

         <snippet>It’s really all about the fighting, carried out in a variety of Asian styles, including one Mr. Jaa invented for the film. Aficionados may find this thrilling. The rest of us will sink lower in our seats.</snippet>

         <snippet>The hatchet-happy editor, ever-attentive to the transient attention span of the film's target audience, barely allows the hero time out from one virtuosic battle before he is flung in the face of a new enemy.</snippet>

         <snippet>You are not likely to see a better display of martial arts combat on screen for some time, even if you have to put up with some excruciating contrivances to get to it.</snippet>

         <snippet>While Jaa clearly hasn't lost any of his stamina in the six years since starring as a different underdog in the original, his first outing as a director is confusing, with distractingly muddy storytelling and wildly varying styles from scene to scene.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, the movie could use a bit of pachyderm memory, given its habit of flashing back to Tien's childhood with exactly the same footage used in previous flashbacks. Instead of the narrative being deepened, it keeps getting shallowed.</snippet>

         <snippet>Elephants aside, the plot of this Ong Bak is rudimentary at best.</snippet>

         <snippet>The criterion couldn't be simpler: does a 20-minute martial arts battle featuring Thai superstar Tony Jaa sound like the ideal way to spend your time and money? If not, move on.</snippet>

         <snippet>Less a traditional martial-artistry marathon than it is an exercise in filmic frustration, lovely to look at by small degrees, but a mud-spattered mess of a movie overall.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not only a step back in time - to 1431 - but a step back in this martial artist's international film career.</snippet>
