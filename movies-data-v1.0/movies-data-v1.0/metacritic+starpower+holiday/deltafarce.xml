         <snippet>If three of "The Magnificent Seven" had been Gomer Pyle, the result might have looked like Delta Farce, a movie rife with fat, fart and Fallujah jokes, but with a subcutaneous wit that has a lot to do with Iraq war fatigue.</snippet>

         <snippet>You could make a case that any movie in which Mexicans and rednecks become best of friends is a net positive for society. But to do that, you'd have to ignore the severe boredom that sets in about halfway through this comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The hilariously dirty insult comic Lisa Lampanelli shows up all too briefly as Engvall's shrewish wife.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perhaps the people most insulted are white Southerners, who presumably are expected to embrace one whopping brain-dead metaphor.</snippet>

         <snippet>Consider this the sequel to "Ernest in the Army " that the late Jim Varney never got around to making. It's not very good but at least it's not evil.</snippet>

         <snippet>Delta Farce is so relentlessly racist (and homophobic), without ever having the intelligence to pass that bigotry off as satire, that viewers will be left thinking "Borat" has a soft touch.</snippet>

         <snippet>Larry the Cable Guy channels both Moe and Curly in the Three Stooges-go-to-war comedy Delta Farce.</snippet>

         <snippet>A mindless comedy where the blatant racial stereotypes are outnumbered only by the flatulence jokes. The best thing that can be said about this movie is it falls just short of being an international incident.</snippet>

         <snippet>The worst thing about Delta Farce is its overall feeling of contempt--for the filmmaking process, for common decency, and, most despicably, for the audience.</snippet>

         <snippet>Here's a sobering thought: If every war gets the comedy it deserves, could Delta Farce, a strenuously unfunny "Three Amigos" knockoff, be our M*A*S*H?</snippet>

         <snippet>If Director C.B. Harding's intention was to make one of the worst films in recent memory, congratulations are in order.</snippet>
