         <snippet>The lovely Audrey Tautou and sad-eyed Gad Elmaleh are perfectly cast as a gold digger and the poor sap who loves her, but the real star of Pierre Salvadori's larky, Lubitsch-esque farce is France's impossibly chic Cote d'Azure.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unlike Salvadori's previous comedy, 2003's "Après Vous," Priceless is less preposterous, and more grounded in character.</snippet>

         <snippet>Calls to mind Lubitsch's "Trouble in Paradise" and beguiles all the way from the parade of umbrellas decorating the opening titles to the closing credits.</snippet>

         <snippet>A cynic is someone who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing, or so the saying goes, but the unadulterated joy Irène takes in throwing open the closet door to show Jean how this gold digging is done is positively infectious.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tautou is a delight, as always, using her bubbly personality to comic advantage. And Elmaleh makes for a sort of poor man's Buster Keaton, perpetually stressed but refusing to surrender, no matter how much damage he sustains to himself or his wallet.</snippet>

         <snippet>Priceless is a supremely satisfying confection – a French romantic comedy of the sort that ends with you standing outside the theatre with a dopey grin on your face.</snippet>

         <snippet>The comedy, which verges on farce from time to time, also has the smilingly cynical approach to romance that we identify with the French.</snippet>

         <snippet>The fetching comedy Priceless”(“Hors de Prix”) weighs about as much as its star, Audrey Tautou,  but like Tautou’s pleasingly craven heroine it knows exactly what it’s doing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Stop laughing long enough, and you'll see that it's a picture about compromised lives and love for sale. But no one who watches Priceless will stop laughing for that long.</snippet>

         <snippet>Salvadori's homage is a bittersweet, funny, sporadically charming and consistently entertaining love story between two "kept" people.</snippet>

         <snippet>Co-scripter/helmer Pierre Salvadori serves up an enjoyable riff on genuine romance versus the pay-as-you-go variety, in crowd-pleasing, exportable picture.</snippet>

         <snippet>Priceless begins as standard, unconvincing, assembly-line French farce and ends as a cop-out, feel-good rom-com. In between, it develops into something considerably more interesting.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The outcome is never much in doubt, but Salvadori artfully choreographs the endless table turning, and the Moroccan-born Elmaleh capitalizes on his striking resemblance to Buster Keaton with a similarly comic composure.</snippet>

         <snippet>Priceless is a bauble - an art-house diamond made of paste that somehow still gives you good glimmer for the money.</snippet>

         <snippet>A farcical romp but, being French, it's hugely glamorous and dripping with style.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is an amusing ball of fluff that refuses to judge its characters’ amoral high jinks. Winking at the vanity of wealthy voluptuaries and hustlers playing games of tainted love, it heaves a sigh and says welcome to the human comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Priceless provides lightweight, predictable entertainment that will make you yearn for the Tatou of yesteryear.</snippet>
