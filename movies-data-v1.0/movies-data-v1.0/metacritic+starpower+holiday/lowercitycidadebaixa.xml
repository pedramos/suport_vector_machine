         <snippet>Director Sérgio Machado, who worked as an assistant to Central Station's Walter Salles, lingers sensually over every wrong move his attractive tragic trio make.</snippet>

         <snippet>Whatever its pretensions of social relevance, Sérgio Machado's Lower City is essentially an exploitation movie, and not a half-bad one at that.</snippet>

         <snippet>The impressive first feature by Sergio Machado, a one-time assistant to Walter Salles ("The Motorcycle Diaries"), is a trip through a grungy world of crime, sex and cockfights.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite the lurid content, this is a beautifully made film that reaches for moral seriousness and resists facile judgments.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though the storyline is dirt simple and not particularly meaningful or involving, the action in this character-driven film is scintillatingly sexy.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the end, Lower City is never quite as energetic as it wants to be, touched by the strange, milky lethargy that steeps every waterfront film.</snippet>

         <snippet>The themes are all familiar and the plot unfolds slowly and in predictable ways, but there's plenty of heat generated by the three leads.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lower City is sexy, but in a nice, dirty way. Everyone in it is deliciously low and sleazy, and so underdressed in the blazing heat that they are just dying to strip.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even though Lower City ultimately leads nowhere (the movie doesn't end so much as simply stop), you won't mind having taken the trip.</snippet>

         <snippet>From its actual and figurative scenes of cockfighting to its copious use of throbbing Brazilian music, there's little here that rises above the level of formula. But director Machado displays a sure touch in his ability to convey the sultry atmosphere of his exotic setting, and he has elicited admirably naturalistic performances from his highly attractive, youthful performers.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie turns out to be a predictable and somewhat sentimental lower-depths love triangle, but Ms. Braga almost makes it work.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story wears thin long before it's over, but Machado draws strong performances from his leads and makes excellent use of its rundown locations.</snippet>

         <snippet>This frenetic potboiler about a love triangle on the Salvador waterfront smacks of liberal slumming and bristles with faux authenticity.</snippet>

         <snippet>Machado establishes a realistically seamy environment for his erotic triangle, and there are some surprisingly tender moments amid the squalor.</snippet>
