         <snippet>Director Jay Lee (The Slaughter) delivers absolutely everything you could possibly hope for in a film called Zombie Strippers, with a consistently hilarious, brutal, and titillating mash-up of "Return of the Living Dead" and "Showgirls" that actually beats out Mark Pirro's "Nudist Colony of the Dead" for the unofficial title of best naked zombie movie ever.</snippet>

         <snippet>Zombie Strippers is a B-movie whose ideas and wit set it well above the great unwashed of the genre.</snippet>

         <snippet>Shouting the title never quite prepared me for either how stripping zombies aren't as hot or as funny as I thought they would be or how quickly the movie's eager intelligence collapses on itself.</snippet>

         <snippet>Whatever planet these dance sequences are happening on, their cuckoo surrealism is the movie's saving grace.</snippet>

         <snippet>On its own low-bar terms, it delivers the goods: pole-dancing, gut-chomping and Jenna J.</snippet>

         <snippet>In spite of the horrific dialogue, and even worse acting, there’s actually something to be said for Zombie Strippers!</snippet>

         <snippet>Shot on ugly digital video with Troma-grade special effects, campy humor and frighteningly bad acting, Zombie Strippers should provide many laughs for stoners watching it on video.</snippet>

         <snippet>Strewn with some surprisingly decent effects, this unevenly paced film delivers, if nothing else, on the promise of its title: lots of surgically enhanced nude dead women strutting their stuff.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jay Lee's grotesque little horror film makes up for in audacity what it might lack in finesse.</snippet>

         <snippet>The action can be bloody, but is mostly routine. Ultimately, the film’s most eye-catching special effects are reserved for bikini waxes and implants.</snippet>

         <snippet>A brilliantly high-concept title and some decent gore aside, you're better off watching the version in your head. It will be infinitely more fun and have markedly improved production values.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie, as its title suggests, means to be one of those Tarantino-esque in-your-face jobs, amusing on the audacity of its outrageousness. Here's how "outrageous" it is: Zzzzzz-zzzz.</snippet>

         <snippet>Currently stopping by theaters briefly en route to DVD, the film tries to position Jameson as the next Linnea Quigley, the B-movie queen behind such enduring titles as "Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers" and "Sorority Babes In The Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama."</snippet>
