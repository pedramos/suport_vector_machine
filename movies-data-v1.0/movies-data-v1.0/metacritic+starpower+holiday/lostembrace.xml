         <snippet>It's in the brightly observed vignettes from mall-society life, captured with a low-key, on-the-run visual style, that Burman shows his best stuff and deadpan wit.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a small movie about a small world, but its modesty is part of what makes it durable and satisfying.</snippet>

         <snippet>The overall effect is of a young director treating some old problems with the cinematic lexicon of his time. So he is able to create warmth without slush.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a film of unexpected, almost indescribable off-center charm that deepens as it goes on.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has a novelist's human touch. Were it a book, it would go somewhere on the shelf with Jonathan Safran Foer and early Philip Roth.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Daniel Burman examines the ways people cope with the passing of time, whether it's weary mall employees, a broken family or the diminishing Argentinean-Jewish community.</snippet>

         <snippet>In Spanish, the title of the film, El abrazo partido, translates into ''a broken embrace,'' a more fitting description of Ariel's feelings for his father.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film takes a whimsical view of this insular and sometimes daft environment where everyone's eccentricities are given an opportunity to shine.</snippet>

         <snippet>A general lack of drama, a low-budget documentary feel and an ultraslim storyline are more than compensated for by a sterling script and performances.</snippet>

         <snippet>At its best, Lost Embrace conveys, with real warmth, the hopelessly intertwined pasts and shared futures of a community of outsiders and immigrants. At worst, it's a sitcom without a laugh track.</snippet>

         <snippet>This delightful riff on the identity crisis of a young Jewish Argentine man deserves both the Grand Jury prize and Best Actor awards it won at last year's Berlin Film Festival.</snippet>

         <snippet>The tedious film might have been worth watching if Burman had given reasons to care about Ariel or anyone else. He doesn't and we don't.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you have the stomach - or the Dramamine - it's a touching, humorous take on Jewish life in contemporary Argentina.</snippet>

         <snippet>Well-served by a laudably authentic ensemble, the director explores both character and ethnicity with a canny wit.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Argentinean writer-director Daniel Burman uses a shaky handheld camera and voice-over narration to take us inside Ariel's head, which gets a bit exhausting, even in the more emotionally satisfying second half.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Despite an absurdly melodramatic premise, Lost Embrace is an essentially plotless series of riffs and jokes. It's 20 minutes too long--forgivable in view of Burman's affection for his material.</snippet>
