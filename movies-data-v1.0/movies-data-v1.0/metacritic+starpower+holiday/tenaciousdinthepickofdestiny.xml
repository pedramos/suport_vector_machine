         <snippet>In the end, Jack, Kyle and director Liam Lynch ("Sarah Silverman: Jesus is Magic") have created more than just a low-brow comedy, they've created a comedic saga, a film more rock show than movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>"The Blues Brothers" it is not, but in its best moments, the movie feels like a comic exaggeration of the real hardships that a couple of average, decidedly unhip guys went through on their unlikely way to the top.</snippet>

         <snippet>In a world in which "Borat" is a global brand, there's certainly a place for Tenacious D -- who, after all, are merely the greatest band in the world: Just ask 'em.</snippet>

         <snippet>Works just like a Tenacious D song. The movie feels giddy and eruptive, dopily enthralled with itself, and more or less made up on the spot.</snippet>

         <snippet>From the looks of it, a good 90 percent of The D's creative juices were expended on The Pick Of Destiny's brilliant opening sequence.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's colorful and determinedly kooky, with "Kung Fu" references and an H.R. Pufnstuf interlude between performances.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is spotty. The short films, essentially comic sketches, were more consistently funny. The movie lags on occasion, but it also has quite a few laughs.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ultimately, Tenacious D is a sight gag -- two unprepossessing, chunky dudes rocking out like wiry guitar gods -- supplemented by spot-on digs at the macho bombast and Dungeons &amp; Dragons silliness that drives heavy-metal mania.</snippet>

         <snippet>Proudly, and often hilariously, juvenile, "Destiny" is packed with typically grandiose Tenacious D anthems - the sort that thrill 15-year-old boys listening alone in their bedrooms.</snippet>

         <snippet>Baked and half-baked, Tenacious D does manage to give the term potty humor a new meaning. That's some kind of genius, right?</snippet>

         <snippet>Not surprisingly, the pic struggles at times to flesh out even its relatively brief 90-odd-minute duration, but it delivers some genuine if generally low-brow laughs along the way.</snippet>

         <snippet>For fans, a crowd-surf over Tenacious D’s best bits. For the unbaptised, a novelty movie of a novelty band, big on spirit but in search of a script.</snippet>

         <snippet>As it wobbles from one episode to the next, The Pick of Destiny is a garish mess, and some of it feels padded. But it has enough jokes to keep you smiling, and the spirit Mr. Black brings to it is a fervent (and touching) affection for the music he spoofs but obviously adores.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the end, you have to possess a sweet spot for Black and his antics to find Tenacious D more than barely watchable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tenacious D is utterly harmless and totally pointless. Black and Gass have been at this so long their dirty little joke has all the punch of a Catskills routine.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's stoner comedy of the most absurd kind, part fryboy mental drizzle, part wink-wink audience baiting, and wholly, utterly funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>A large amount of dope is smoked in The Pick of Destiny, perhaps the most since the salad days of Cheech &amp; Chong. This may be the problem. Pot rarely helped anybody's comic timing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Black and Kyle Gass started their acoustic/heavy metal rock music comedy act back in the late 1980s. Gold albums and HBO shorts followed, now this. Still, any movie featuring Jack Black with an appearance by Sasquatch is not a total loss, and, for those who care, we learn the origin of the group's name.</snippet>
