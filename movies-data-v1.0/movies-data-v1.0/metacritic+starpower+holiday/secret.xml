         <snippet>A complicated family story that takes place in three distinct time periods, and that's handled with astonishing ease and fluidity by director Claude Miller.</snippet>

         <snippet>A gripping mystery and an ever-timely reminder of the terrible power of repression and silence.</snippet>

         <snippet>A Secret is suitably tense, sad, and deeply poignant as it moves toward an epilogue exploring the idea that everything rots and decays, no mater how well-maintained.</snippet>

         <snippet>Nearly every melodramatic impulse has been suppressed in favor of a calm precision that serves both to intensify and delay the emotional impact of the filmâ€™s climactic disclosures.</snippet>

         <snippet>A clanking, old-fashioned period drama infused with almost unbearable grief, Claude Miller's film A Secret has an enormous significance in France that it can never possess elsewhere.</snippet>

         <snippet>The filmmaker's decision to shoot the past in color and the present in murky black and white is an inspired visual translation of psychological truth.</snippet>

         <snippet>The acting is exceptional. If parts of A Secret veer toward soap opera, the ensemble work reduces the suds to a minimum.</snippet>

         <snippet>Claude Miller's ravishingly shot drama A Secret gives up its titular mystery early, so it may seem odd to speak of the suspense it generates.</snippet>

         <snippet>A fine drama that stands as Gallic vet Claude Miller's best in at least a decade.</snippet>

         <snippet>Deepened by its complex back-and-forth chronology, deft shifts in perspective, and a significantly counterintuitive color-coding of past and present, A Secret suggests that it's not illicit passion, but rather the crime of denial, that has screwed up this family down the generations.</snippet>

         <snippet>Beautifully acted and exquisitely photographed, director Claude Miller's superb drama, from Philippe Grimbert's autobiographical novel, is awash with the ripples created by unlived lives.</snippet>

         <snippet>The fractured timeline covers five decades, which Miller weaves together, with the past shot in color and the present in black and white. Still, the soapy climax is unnecessary.</snippet>
