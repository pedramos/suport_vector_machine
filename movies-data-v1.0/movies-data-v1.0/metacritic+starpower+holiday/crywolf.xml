         <snippet>Which is scarier: a maniac in an orange ski mask wielding a hunting knife - or Jon Bon Jovi as a journalism teacher?  Cry_Wolf gives us both, and though Bon Jovi is livin' on a prayer if he thinks he's an actor, the movie is a find.</snippet>

         <snippet>A clever teen thriller with intricate plotting, deft characterizations, sharp ensemble performances and a darkly ironic twist at the end.</snippet>

         <snippet>The low splatter quotient may not be enough to quell the blood lust of slasher fans, but several neat plot twists - and a surprise ending - make Cry Wolf  a cut above the rest.</snippet>

         <snippet>A cut above the usual level of slasher films, with its overly convoluted plot enhanced by an impressive level of cinematic style. It also places a greater emphasis on surprising plot twists than gore.</snippet>

         <snippet>First-time screenwriters Jeff Wadlow and Beau Bauman prove more adept at staging mind games than creating chills and thrills for the audience.</snippet>

         <snippet>But clich√©d rapid-fire editing and cheap-looking digital-image manipulation drain away every ounce of atmosphere, and overexplanation blows what could have been a darkly ambiguous ending.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Jeff Wadlow and his co-writer/producer Beau Bauman throw in a couple of gripping sequences, especially one set in a library sub-basement with an energy-saving lighting system, but for a film that's essentially one big logic problem, there's an unfortunate absence of logic to the way its characters behave.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cry_Wolf is underscored with idiot adolescent excitement (and gets extra absurdist points for casting Jon Bon Jovi as an educator).</snippet>

         <snippet>A second-rate slasher, but it shows the odd bit of directorial promise and a great deal of ambition.</snippet>

         <snippet>This was a better movie back when it was called "Gossip" . . . oh, wait, no -- that one sucked too.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cry Wolf is one of those movies that's rated PG-13 not because the producers wanted to get the broadest audience possible, but because no one 17 or older would be sucker enough to fall for it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite an ambitious script from Wadlow and Beau Bauman, it's extremely difficult to care, seeing as how these tropes have already been recycled enough to make Greenpeace proud.</snippet>
