         <snippet>So just do yourself a favor, get out there and see Ong Bak. You’ll leave the theater bruised and battered, but you'll be happy about it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Infusion of comedy elements keeps the story light, without dragging it into the cartoonish.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ong-Bak (taken from the name of the sacred statue) is delivered raw, with an on-the-fly compositional approach from director Prachya Pinkaew that includes dim lighting and jumbled editing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Without doubt, Jaa's a star — a man very possibly worthy of the 'new Bruce Lee' tag.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Jaa, blessed with astonishing muscle definition and a stoical, sensitive face, clearly has the potential to be an international action movie star, and Ong-Bak feels like the start of a scrappy, potent franchise.</snippet>

         <snippet>Strongly recalls Hong Kong kung-fu movies of the late '60s and '70s, with physical grit, over-the-top heroics and inventive fight choreography providing the entertainment.</snippet>

         <snippet>The ferocious fighting moves (adapted from ancient Muay Thai manuals by veteran Thai martial arts director Phanna Rithikrai) that constitute Ong-Bak's money shots are often truly astonishing.</snippet>

         <snippet>But the best way to enjoy Ong Bak is on its own gritty, low-budget level, skins, brains, and guts galore, a viscerally entertaining slice of Thai filmmaking that will leave you grinning ear to ear.</snippet>

         <snippet>Did I enjoy Ong-Bak? As brainless but skillful action choreography, yes. And I would have enjoyed it even more if I'd known going in that the stunts were being performed in the old-fashioned, pre-computer way.</snippet>

         <snippet>Every action scene is a spectacularly choreographed set piece. At one point, Jaa literally fights with feet of fire. Unfortunately, whenever he comes down to earth, so does the movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ong-Bak's script, if you can call it that, is nothing but a series of setups for star Tony Jaa to show his stuff.</snippet>

         <snippet>Refreshingly free of the hyperbole of special effects...Ong-Bak will win no scriptwriting awards, but Jaa is definitely the real deal.</snippet>

         <snippet>The meat of the matter is fight sequences, and rather than being goosed with now-common digital effects and Hong Kong-style wirework, it's all real and all breathtaking.</snippet>

         <snippet>Thus a tightly edited, 90-minute action flick becomes a bloated, 105-minute exercise on how not to direct an action film.</snippet>
