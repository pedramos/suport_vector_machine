         <snippet>Despite its cargo of meaning, 3-Iron feels marvelously weightless, like the lovers as they stand on a scale that the hero has fixed.</snippet>

         <snippet>The insinuating quality of 3-Iron is irresistible.</snippet>

         <snippet>3-Iron gains its hypnotic power by observing these characters through a slight remove. With total command of his effects, Kim transforms an already peculiar romance into something as otherworldly as a ghost story.</snippet>

         <snippet>It sounds high-minded, but 3-Iron is in fact simple and economical, blessedly straighforward, absorbing, and hard to forget.</snippet>

         <snippet>3-Iron is like a Raymond Carver story that slowly, inexorably takes on the dimensions of a ghostly fairy tale.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kim's wittiest effort to date, with a wordless performance by Jae Hee that recalls Keaton and Chaplin.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dreamlike and the slightest bit precious, the film is a beautiful, over-cultivated hothouse flower.</snippet>

         <snippet>The sooner you let yourself go with Kim's flow, the more likely you are to come away satisfied. Think of it as South Korea's answer to "Memento," just don't think too hard.</snippet>

         <snippet>Taut even when ridiculous, with flashes of comedy, 3-Iron has less to offer than its predecessors, but at minimum it's the playful exhaustion of a formal constraint.</snippet>

         <snippet>The almost supernatural turn which Kim's lovely film takes during its final act, however, is totally unexpected, and just one reason why Kim ranks as one of the most justly celebrated talents in contemporary Korean cinema.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's actually quite satisfying, in a weird, magical-realism sort of way that manages to disturb and confound as much as it appeases the romantic.</snippet>

         <snippet>As a writer-director, he's (Kim Ki-Duk) a wizard with the camera but a plebe with a pen. His latest, 3-Iron, continues the frustrating trend.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is slightly less interesting and less appealing even as arthouse fare.</snippet>

         <snippet>3-Iron is at times deliciously sensual, creepily somnolent, whimsically spiritual and disturbingly violent. But it is never quite coherent.</snippet>

         <snippet>There is a vengeance motif that is worked out in a way that is both emotionally satisfying and completely unbelievable.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>As repellent and repellently opportunistic a piece of work as the various shock-horror provocations (The Isle, The Coast Guard) that helped to launch this worrisome career (Kim Ki-Duk).</snippet>
