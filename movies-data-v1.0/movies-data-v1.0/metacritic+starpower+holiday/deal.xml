         <snippet>Christian Slater and Selma Blair head a solid cast that Harvey Kahn directs with cool efficiency as the tension steadily rises with every passing minute.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although the dialogue initially flakes with awkward exposition, writer Ruth Epstein and director Harvey Kahn have fashioned a riveting thriller full of good scares and learned, muckraking insight into the global labyrinth of oil and politics.</snippet>

         <snippet>But the problem is, The Deal, like a lot of real-life Wall Street deals, is a labyrinth into which the plot tends to disappear. The ideas in the film are challenging, the level of expertise is high, the performances are convincing, and it's only at the level of story construction and dramatic clarity that the film doesn't succeed.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you don't mind the telegraphed punches of Ruth Epstein's script and Harvey Kahn's direction, this should carry you along.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's when The Deal leaves the corporate offices behind that the story turns into a bogus, convoluted mess. Once the Russian mafia, personified by Angie Harmon playing an evil seductress with a terrible Russian accent, rears its head, the ballgame is over.</snippet>

         <snippet>The subject is intriguing even if the dialogue is stilted and the acting is uneven.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film might have worked as a taut, topical corporate intrigue thriller; instead, for all its ambition, it's just a routine mystery, despite a solid performance by Christian Slater.</snippet>

         <snippet>Shot largely in Toronto and cast with the best of the B-list, this film has the low-rent gloss of a made-for-cable thriller.</snippet>

         <snippet>If Epstein and Kahn's plot mechanics were as fresh as the headlines from which they borrow, they might have been on to something.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story's unnecessary and unconvincing Russian spies are out of "Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle," but Blair is quite enjoyable as a sassy, capable idealist.</snippet>

         <snippet>The thriller plot sputters and the romance between Slater and eco-friendly Harvard MBA Selma Blair is a nonstarter, but the movie's threadbare execution actually enhances its queasy vision of a nation in decline.</snippet>

         <snippet>If Slater were a bigger star, this self-serving vehicle would have been a hoot, a surefire DVD attraction for any Camp Night in the living room, not to mention a shoo-in for one of the 10 worst movies of 2005.</snippet>
