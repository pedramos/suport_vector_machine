         <snippet>Considerably less slick than "An Inconvenient Truth," and no less urgent.</snippet>

         <snippet>The one film to see on this most crucial subject.</snippet>

         <snippet>The word bears repeating, so everyone from Andrew Weil to Stephen Hawking to Mikhail Gorbachev is here to speak the still-inconvenient truth. The filmmaking, however, is far more relentless than in that Oscar-winning Al Gore slide show.</snippet>

         <snippet>Thankfully for audiences, 11th Hour is not without hope. The filmmakers save the most exhilarating portion for last when they ask what's being done about the problems.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ultimately a triumph of redemptive ideas that DiCaprio ­-- God bless his celebrity -- may finally succeed in transporting from the environmental fringe to the mainstream moviegoing audience.</snippet>

         <snippet>An unnerving, surprisingly affecting documentary about our environmental calamity, is such essential viewing.</snippet>

         <snippet>As The 11th Hour's message of Profound Importance warrants a four-star rating, the film itself does not.</snippet>

         <snippet>An impassioned ecology-themed documentary that ultimately is more rewarding for informational than cinematic reasons.</snippet>

         <snippet>Arguably a more important movie, which more clearly lays out what must be done to save the world, and how we can begin.</snippet>

         <snippet>It isn’t much of a movie (unless your aesthetic was formed in high-school science class), but it will be hugely informative to aliens who land on this planet in a thousand years and wonder why there’s no welcoming committee.</snippet>

         <snippet>Presents the viewer with reams of depressing data, loads of hand-wringing about the woeful state of humanity and, finally, some altogether fascinating ideas about how to go about solving the climate crisis.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though the filmmaking isn't everything it might have been (the opening montage is especially clumsy), their argument is compelling, absorbing, and urgent.</snippet>

         <snippet>While it's a well-constructed doc, full of relevant information and geared toward those people who still might be fence-sitters on the subject, there's something missing from The 11th Hour's lengthy procession of talking heads: a sense of maddened outrage.</snippet>

         <snippet>This activist documentary -- alternately impassioned, despairing, edifying, and hectoring about all the ways humans are screwing up the earth in a death rattle of hubris -- shouts, People, do something! In contrast, "An Inconvenient Truth" feels positively hushed.</snippet>

         <snippet>As much a call to action as a documentary, it's a compelling and sobering lesson in the devastating effect of human industry on the planet. But a lesson nonetheless.</snippet>

         <snippet>The 11th Hour is a bit like "An Inconvenient Truth" at Woodstock: a little spacey, a little preoccupied with self-love and prone to the occasional freakout.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perhaps the most sobering statistic in The 11th Hour: Some 50,000 species a year are disappearing. Someday, it might be humans.</snippet>

         <snippet>The picture almost beats its theme to death -- the first hour is enough -- but the imaginative designers dreaming up a cleaner future end this Cassandra cry on an upbeat note.</snippet>

         <snippet>If it gets people thinking about which light bulbs they buy and their current gas mileage and such, then it's good to have it in the world. It is, however, a panicky blur as documentaries go.</snippet>

         <snippet>The 11th Hour is slick and passionate, but neither persuasive nor helpful; it's a headache of a film directed like an Errol Morris project, but with half the substance. It's clearly preaching to the choir, but even they may find it off-key.</snippet>
