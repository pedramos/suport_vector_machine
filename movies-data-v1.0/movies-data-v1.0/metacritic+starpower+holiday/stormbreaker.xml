         <snippet>It's better than some James Bond movies--no matter what your age.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though the film is not terribly original (and features a jarringly miscast Alicia Silverstone as Alex's nanny), the action scenes are diverting, the veteran cast is amusing and the engaging Pettyfer makes a solid debut.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite a relatively paltry $40 million budget, Stormbreaker has the sheen and special effects of a Bond movie, and the ambition as well.</snippet>

         <snippet>For kids strung out on Anthony Horowitz's 007-lite adventure series, this maiden adaptation is a pleasant enough diversion from having to flip the pages.</snippet>

         <snippet>Taken for what it is - 'tweenage escapism - Stormbreaker is moderately fun.</snippet>

         <snippet>The nonstop action in this British romp should ensure that its target audience, sugar-buzzed prepubescent boys, stay strapped in their seats.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Pettyfer is no Sean Connery, no Roger Moore, no Pierce Brosnan, no Timothy Dalton and no George Lazenby even, but the director, Geoffrey Sax, compensates for his zero of a hero by indulging the exceedingly amused and amusing supporting cast.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sax keeps things moving, but the best thing about the film is the British cast.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rourke's hammy, eyeliner-enhanced acting alone almost makes Alex Rider worth a look.</snippet>

         <snippet>Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker is "Agent Cody Banks" played British and kinda straight -- that is, as straight as you can when your villain, who dispatches foes with a giant jellyfish, is played by a toothpick-chomping Mickey Rourke in purple eye shadow.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is forever trying to balance between being for younger teenagers and keeping their parents occupied as well, and never quite gets it right.</snippet>

         <snippet>A British flick based on the first novel in a popular teenage spy-thriller series by Anthony Horowitz, looks promising but, unfortunately, doesn't measure up.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perhaps as a publishing phenomenon the concept works, but on-screen it's pretty dull, with good actors in bad roles and bad special effects.</snippet>

         <snippet>A shake 'n' bake Brit teen-spy actioner, without a smidgeon of originality, humor or involving characterization, Stormbreaker is a high-profile bust.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's ostensibly an action movie, and the action is so poorly shot as to be embarrassing.</snippet>

         <snippet>While it's filled with quality actors, this James Bond tale for tweens feels like something you should be getting for free on television.</snippet>

         <snippet>About as clunky as a movie gets. It lurches from scene to scene with no sense of narrative grace, gives its roster of prominent actors nothing to work with and screeches to a halt with all the grace of a sprinter whose shoelaces have been tied together.</snippet>
