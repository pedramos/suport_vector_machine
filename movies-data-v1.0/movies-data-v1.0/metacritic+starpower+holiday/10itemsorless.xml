         <snippet>An amiable demonstration of how two charismatic actors and a relaxed writer-director (Brad Silberling) can squeeze an enjoyable movie out of practically nothing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Proceeds at that pace to an ending that is as inevitable as it is poignant.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ten Items or Less is not landmark cinema nor is it deeply thought-provoking, but it's smart, funny, knowledgeable about life and people, and a crowd-pleaser.</snippet>

         <snippet>Moves at an agreeable, meandering pace but never loses its verve or its sharp humor.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a picture with nothing to prove, and not all that much to say, but its modesty and good humor make it hard to resist.</snippet>

         <snippet>10 Items or Less is not deep, but it's a charming enough diversion to spend a day with two likable people.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's nice to see a bit of intimate, offhanded moviemaking that focuses on actors, as opposed to stars.</snippet>

         <snippet>Freeman is clearly enjoying himself, but his charisma and heavyweight presence can't quite redeem this featherweight concoction.</snippet>

         <snippet>10 Items or Less is nearly an acting class exercise, except for the fact that these two have long since graduated.</snippet>

         <snippet>Interplay between a jaunty Freeman as an unemployed movie star and the magnetic Paz Vega as a no-nonsense grocery store checker gives pic humanity and lift.</snippet>

         <snippet>By the end, 10 Items Or Less has the obnoxiousness of a vanity project. Freeman is having a better time than we are.</snippet>

         <snippet>So slight that it barely qualifies as a movie, 10 Items or Less squeaks by on the charm of its leads.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's just a little film that strives to be likable, and is less so than it might have been.</snippet>

         <snippet>Every potentially worthwhile or amusing moment in writer-director Brad Silberling's 10 Items or Less could be told in 10 minutes or less, with credits included.</snippet>

         <snippet>I don't know if it's ickier to assume that writer-director Brad Silberling (Moonlight Mile) thinks the culture-clash jokes he pushes in 10 Items or Less are charming because they're earnest, or because they're tongue-in-cheek. Either way, this sale is void.</snippet>
