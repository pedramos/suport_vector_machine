         <snippet>The blessings of salvation have rarely felt so mixed, the parameters of Lolita-hood so elusive - which is exactly Martel's specialty.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's wealth in themes provokes unsettling thought, even as it feels meager in thesis.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a marvelously acted film, driven by a sweaty-palmed, exponentially mounting tension.</snippet>

         <snippet>A subtle artist and a sharp observer, Martel manages a large cast with an ease that matches her skill at storytelling, within which psychological insight and social comment flow easily and implicitly.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Not the least remarkable thing about this deadpan, deceptively haphazard ensemble comedy, a movie as much choreographed as directed, is the way that--at the final moment--the mist simply evaporates.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>It's a style at once ravishing and mysterious, austere and intimate, carrying with it the suggestion that even cinema may be powerless to invade the most clandestine antechambers of human behavior.</snippet>

         <snippet>Adjusting to Martel's style requires patience, but her indirection pays dividends, culminating in an unforgettable final shot that flies in the face of narrative expectations.</snippet>

         <snippet>Young and bold and bristling with talent, Argentine director Lucrecia Martel has continued right where she left off in her feature debut.</snippet>

         <snippet>A mystifying film that holds the audience in suspense over where it's going and what it might mean for almost its entire running time.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>As Martel points out, the movie is about the "difficulties" and "dangers" of "differentiating good from evil," and it requires as well as rewards a fair amount of alertness from the viewer.</snippet>

         <snippet>Alche has an amazingly expressive face and becomes such a magnetic presence that you'll feel a distinct need to rescue her.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>In stripping her potentially lurid material of salacious appeal, Martel also makes it murky and oddly arid, a mind-numbing exercise rather than an experience.</snippet>
