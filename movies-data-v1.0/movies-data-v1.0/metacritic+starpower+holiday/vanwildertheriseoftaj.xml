         <snippet>The Rise of Taj is relatively pointless in the scheme of things, but refreshing in what it (mostly) doesn't resort to for laughs.</snippet>

         <snippet>Everything old is old again in this rickety extension of 2002's already rickety "Van Wilder."</snippet>

         <snippet>Penn, who probably didn't need this shoddy placeholder after the cult success of "Harold &amp; Kumar Go To White Castle's," acquits himself with a gentle charisma that makes the crudity go down easy. Granted, it's still s---, but with a sweeter odor than usual.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ryan Reynolds isn't around this time - and neither is most of the wit.</snippet>

         <snippet>National Lampoonâ€™s Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj harnesses smut and silliness to an oddly innocent tale of true love.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is shocking only for its tepidness; except for some raunchy language, it's ready-made for basic cable.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you liked "Van Wilder," which starred Ryan Reynolds and Tara Reid, be warned: The only person returning from the cast is the boring Indian kid Taj Mahal Badalandabad (Kal Penn).</snippet>

         <snippet>The laughs are low, the breasts are high, and the film is instantly forgettable.</snippet>

         <snippet>While Kal Penn manages a decent lead performance as Taj, the writing is terrible.</snippet>

         <snippet>So blatantly not funny that it might as well have been called "National Geographic's Van Wilder 2."</snippet>

         <snippet>So why not a sequel that subtracts the only good thing about the first movie, Ryan Reynolds? When Tara Reid won't even come back, you know things can't be good.</snippet>

         <snippet>The four-years-in-the-making, badly recycled (not to mention awful) sequel might stain the honor of the Lampoon label if it hadn't already produced several even worse films.</snippet>

         <snippet>To make a movie this charmless and uninspired takes a certain negligence that is rare among even the most cynical Hollywood moneymaking exercises.</snippet>

         <snippet>Granted, the state of the indie hipster and/or Big-Man-on-the-Quad aesthetic has probably skewed a bit since I was a frosh, but good lord, man, it can't be this pale an imitation of campus life. I implore you: Go rent "National Lampoon's Animal House" and leave this flaccid wanker alone.</snippet>
