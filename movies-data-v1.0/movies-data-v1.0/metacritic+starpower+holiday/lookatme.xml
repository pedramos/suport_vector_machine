         <snippet>The wry filmmaker has created an urbane society of family and friends as ridiculously pretentious and hypocritical as they are cultured, accomplished, and posh.</snippet>

         <snippet>This audience-pleaser is smart and acerbic. Jaoui has an uncanny ear - as director, co-writer and part of the inspired ensemble cast - for human foibles, self-deception, celebrity worship and female body issues.</snippet>

         <snippet>What makes Look at Me such a deeply satisfying experience is its ability to combine insightful character portraits like this with wickedly funny situations that slyly skewer all-too-human weaknesses.</snippet>

         <snippet>This bonbon spiked with malice is a triumph for Jaoui, who takes witty and wounding measure of the small betrayals that leave bruises on us all.</snippet>

         <snippet>With a light, sometimes hilarious touch, Look at Me deflates the pretensions and self-obsessed nature of a group of wealthy Parisian literati, but its observations about the effects of fame and success and our natural desire to fan them as high as they can go, apply to anyone within range of reality-TV culture.</snippet>

         <snippet>In lesser hands, all this might border on misanthropy. But Jaoui's direction, plus the note-perfect cast, manage two redeeming feats:</snippet>

         <snippet>The thing about a movie like this is, the characters may be French, but they're more like people I know than they could ever be in the Hollywood remake.</snippet>

         <snippet>A movie of biting social observation. And it masterfully avoids Manichaean simplicity.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Directed by Agnès Jaoui, who made the equally delightful "The Taste of Others," this comedy of manners with a serious purpose centers on a group of loosely connected neurotics, all working in the rarefied worlds of amateur chorales.</snippet>

         <snippet>Punchy dialogue, excellent thesping and a real feel for the universal tuning fork of great classical music make this a prime candidate for international arthouse play.</snippet>

         <snippet>Look at Me is on the talky side, but like Jaoui's directing debut, "The Taste of Others," it offers uniformly excellent performances and smart observations on social and family interactions.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is for a particular audience - those who like films that concentrate on character rather than plot, and who aren't put off by subtitles.</snippet>

         <snippet>While Jaoui's film is interesting to watch, it dawdles enough to lose its storytelling grip.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jaoui directs with flow and affection, and she plays Sylvia sensitively. Bacri has the right middle-aged assortment of humors.</snippet>

         <snippet>The French title is Comme une image ("like an image"), but Tennessee Williams's phrase "the catastrophe of success" seems more appropriate.</snippet>

         <snippet>The multitalented Jaoui and Bacri excel on every level; her direction is efficient and unobtrusive, their script dissects the nuances of corruption by celebrity with a razor-sharp scalpel, and they deliver a pair of subtly unsparing performances.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a bleak, unresolved film, with no release. What keeps it from being a mortal bummer is the music-exquisite sacred choral works, plus Mozart.</snippet>
