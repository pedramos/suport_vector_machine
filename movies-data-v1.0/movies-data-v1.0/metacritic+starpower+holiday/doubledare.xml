         <snippet>Thrilling stunt footage aside, this is a film that celebrates the strength of women in the entertainment industry and these two separate stories are tied together perfectly by filmmaker Amanda Micheli.</snippet>

         <snippet>Given how well Micheli captures the personality and aspirations of two complicated professionals, it's too bad she never answers the key question: What makes one person a stuntwoman, and another a star?</snippet>

         <snippet>The stuntwomen are also subject to the unbreakable law of Hollywood, that the advantage is always to the young and beautiful.</snippet>

         <snippet>It shows the hardship that women -- especially older women -- must endure in a male-dominated business.</snippet>

         <snippet>Focuses on a parallel universe that moviegoers rarely consider: that of the invisible, hard-working craftspeople who put the illusion together.</snippet>

         <snippet>The more interesting woman is Epper, who comes from a highly respected family of stunt doubles and at 62 shows no signs of slowing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Viewers are left feeling that it's still a male-dominated profession, but that determined women like these might just effect some small change.</snippet>

         <snippet>Less a history of a specialty that scarcely existed before the '70s -- men habitually donned wigs and dresses to double for women -- than a portrait of two women, one beginning her career and the other in the twilight of hers.</snippet>
