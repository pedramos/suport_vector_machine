         <snippet>When Riyadh's family jokes about the purple stain that marks them as resistance targets after they vote, the black humor speaks volumes about them as individuals, as Sunnis and as Iraqis with a dream of a better way.</snippet>

         <snippet>It seems easily the most valuable piece of film to emerge about the war in all of its three-plus years.</snippet>

         <snippet>Poitras boldly dispenses with the traditional documentary voice-over, but her film is filled with telling moments that are far more eloquent than any scripted narration.</snippet>

         <snippet>A keenly constructed and tragic film, probably the best documentary so far to depict the Iraqi side of the current conflict.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perhaps the most telling image in this remarkable movie is that of a relative intently swatting flies in Riyadh's house, while fighting rages outside.</snippet>

         <snippet>What My Country, My Country does best is show us that while both the Americans and the Iraqis care about the country's future, their cultural backgrounds and world views inevitably make them seem alien to each other.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even the most ardent of neoconservatives might find this intimate and nuanced documentary about life in occupied Iraq difficult to shake â€“ all politics aside, it is the human element that ultimately defines a nation as a people.</snippet>

         <snippet>Reserving the only trace of editorializing for the end credits, which list some sobering numbers on the occupation and this so-called successful election, Poitras mainly allows her subjects and the circumstances to speak for themselves.</snippet>

         <snippet>Gotham-based documaker Laura Poitras ("Flag Wars") comes up with a still-timely, quietly hard-hitting look at the Iraqi situation with My Country, My Country, focusing on the lead-up to and outcome of the Jan. 30, 2005, Iraq election.</snippet>

         <snippet>While My Country, My Country is hardly an exhaustive depiction of its subject, it provides much in the way of material and perspectives previously unexposed.</snippet>

         <snippet>Without comment but with unusual sensitivity, Ms. Poitras, exposes the emotional toll of occupation on Iraqis and American soldiers alike.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though the events have a rambling overfamiliarity, there's a real story between the lines: the resentment over the U.S. occupation on the part of non-insurgent Iraqis.</snippet>

         <snippet>The subject of Iraq haunts and divides us so much these days that a film like Laura Poitras' documentary My Country My Country is valuable, no matter its level of achievement.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even on that happy 2005 election day, which was so successful that it led to a December round of elections in which the Sunnis did participate, Poitras takes a break to show us a close-up of someone slitting the neck of a rooster.</snippet>
