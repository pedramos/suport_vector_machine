         <snippet>Without question, the best crime movie of the year--and one of the best movies of any sort now playing.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie itself is as slick, fast and terrifyingly violent as a top-grade American crime thriller, but a lot smarter than most.</snippet>

         <snippet>Watch Jan Decleir's performance. He never goes for the easy effect, never pushes too hard, is a rock-solid occupant of his character.</snippet>

         <snippet>A cracking police procedural from Belgian director Erik van Looy, has a jaw-dropping premise so smartly executed that if this movie weren't in Flemish I'd swear that Michael Mann had directed it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Belgian actor [Jan] Decleir's tough-guy vulnerability ... gives an otherwise standard police procedural extraordinary grace and power.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Erik Van Looy skillfully profiles both the assassin (Jan Decleir, suggesting a tougher, over-the-hill version of Michel Piccoli) and the Antwerp detectives investigating his crimes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wonderfully acted and energetically filmed, and in fact it partly echoes a real-life pedophilia scandal that rocked Belgian society to its foundations in the '90s.</snippet>

         <snippet>This award-winning picture from Belgium is the kind Hollywood seems no longer interested in making: a sophisticated drama that presumes a level of insight and maturity in an audience that doesn't need winks and arrows to understand what's going on.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is tightly wound and expertly unraveled, resulting in a thriller that you'll remember â€“ unlike the hitman Ledda.</snippet>

         <snippet>With solid performances, competent direction and artfully drab cinematography, the film would be indistinguishable from a Hollywood thriller if not for the Flemish dialogue. It's no surprise to learn that an American remake is in the works.</snippet>

         <snippet>This Belgian crime thriller makes compelling viewing out of a "you can't be serious" plotline.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although comparisons to the memory-challenged machinations of "Memento" are inevitable, the plotting here takes a more traditionally linear path.</snippet>

         <snippet>Van Looy has created a fast-paced and stylish thriller. Declair's Ledda, marvelously suave and vulnerable, provides most of the pathos.</snippet>

         <snippet>A lot of thrillers have asked us to identify with assassins -- but I'd be hard-pressed to name one that makes a hitman as sympathetic, if not sentimental, as The Memory of a Killer.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Erik Van Looy has filmmaking chops to spare, and while he has created a sharply shot and crisply paced film, he isn't able to make it all cohere.</snippet>

         <snippet>Initially, the film comes off as a poor man's "Memento," but it gradually becomes apparent that it's only really interested in its protagonist's Alzheimer's as a cheap plot point to be manipulated or discarded as the filmmakers see fit.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you're one of those people who complained that "Memento" could just as well have been told in chronological order, The Memory of a Killer may be your cup of tea.</snippet>
