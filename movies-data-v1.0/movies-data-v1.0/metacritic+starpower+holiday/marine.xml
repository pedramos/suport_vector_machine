         <snippet>A throwback to all those guilty pleasure action movies.</snippet>

         <snippet>While The Marine proves a poor showcase for the charisma-impaired Cena, it's a terrific vehicle for world-class heavy Patrick, who is clearly enjoying himself as the kind of deranged lunatic who interrupts a long string of felonies to confirm the details of his new cable package.</snippet>

         <snippet>A delectably bad '80s-style actioner.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's saving grace are its fast pacing and generous doses of humor, the latter of which is mostly provided by Robert Patrick's sly delivery of the many wisecracks doled out by his villainous character.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tongues are planted firmly in cheek; it’s impossible to endorse a full price ticket, but fans of campy action should check this out.</snippet>

         <snippet>Granted, this movie is unlikely to threaten "The Departed" at Oscar time. But for mindless entertainment, you could do a lot worse.</snippet>

         <snippet>What follows is serviceable action set to music you'd find in a video game -- or a military ad.</snippet>

         <snippet>Junky, jokey and sometimes both at once, pic marks yet another attempt by World Wrestling Entertainment to establish one of its burly superstars as a movie lead.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Marine is bad in just the right way, a mindless throwaway that's at least smart enough not to take itself too seriously.</snippet>

         <snippet>What’s a muscular guy like John Cena doing in a flabby movie like this? This connect-the-dots action-adventure may appeal to undemanding ten-year-old boys but will bore everyone else.</snippet>

         <snippet>Co-starring as Rome, the ringleader with "intimacy issues," Robert Patrick appears to be enjoying himself. That makes one of us.</snippet>

         <snippet>Patrick leaves no scenery unchewed, and, in doing so, he gives life to an otherwise by-the-book script and proves once again that in Hollywood, it’s usually the bad guys who turn out to be the best characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie's prideful silliness makes it semi-watchable in the manner of Saturday afternoon cable flicks like "Delta Force."</snippet>
