         <snippet>Outside of "Grindhouse," it may be the most bang for your buck to be had in a Los Angeles movie theater this season.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like any good sequel, this film takes what is familiar with the original's concept -- in this case, an internecine struggle for supremacy -- and deepens it.</snippet>

         <snippet>In To's movies no one is innocent, and the social corruption has reached down to the soul. He orchestrates action scenes with an elegance that suggests Scorsese.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not all violence and brutality. To allows his morbid sense of humor to shine through. There are moments of absurd hilarity that don't necessarily lighten the mood so much as bring it down to earth. The performances are strong all around.</snippet>

         <snippet>Plenty of films owe a debt to "The Godfather," but it's rare to see inspiration used as successfully as it is here.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is an extremely violent movie, with one long gory scene that's particularly hard to stomach. The great majority of Triad Election is about political maneuvering, but when the conversations end, the blood flows mightily.</snippet>

         <snippet>As in the first movie, To deftly references the "Godfather" trilogy, examining the moral equivocation and shifting alliances among various syndicate members.</snippet>
