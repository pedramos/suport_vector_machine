         <snippet>Another worthy performance comes from Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a magnificent miniature, a supremely tender work that's full of emotion and even sentimentality.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is the most personal, deeply felt film from the gifted director of "Under the Sand" and "Swimming Pool." Ozon leaches his melodrama of all sentimentality, and moves us all the more.</snippet>

         <snippet>Time to Leave just might be Ozon's best work yet. He tackles a sensitive, off-putting subject with a dignity that will put viewers at ease. Poupaud connects as the dying man and Moreau is - Moreau, a French national treasure.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film rests entirely on Poupaud's shoulders, and he rises to the demands of a complex, deeply unsympathetic role.</snippet>

         <snippet>What makes the film intriguing, and somewhat off-putting, is that Romain is deliberately portrayed as a heel; he strains his relations with his lover and his family, except for his grandmother (Moreau), to the breaking point.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Time to Leave subordinates narrative to mood. Since the end of the story is never in doubt, the only surprises lie in the particulars of Romain’s behavior and the nuances of sorrow, determination and doubt that pass over Mr. Poupaud’s face.</snippet>

         <snippet>As with all Ozon's work, Time to Leave resounds with grace notes. The wide-screen cinematography by Jeanne Lapoirie offsets (or maybe disguises) the movie's narrow scope, and there's something private--withholding--in Poupaud's beauty that gives his misanthropy a touch of mystery.</snippet>

         <snippet>The same quiet ecstasy that made the final moments of "Under the Sand" so moving works on the viewer here too, inspiring joy and naked grief in equal measure.</snippet>

         <snippet>The splendid, painterly melodramas of Douglas Sirk lurk behind every shot, but the tone is essentially pre-Raphaelite, sexy and cold.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ozon's disappointing new film Time To Leave is his "The Flower Of My Secret," a Douglas Sirk-inspired weepie about a terminal cancer victim making amends, but it's a little too sentimental and square even by his recent standards.</snippet>

         <snippet>Moreau's few ripe scenes are choice, and she spices up the joint with her gravelly voice of je ne regrette rien.</snippet>

         <snippet>Francois Ozon's Time to Leave reps one of the helmer's most straightforward, but perhaps least interesting pics.</snippet>

         <snippet>Time to Leave amounts simply to a semi-thoughtful disease-of-the-week weepie, admirable in its restraint but shying from the terror of the situation.</snippet>

         <snippet>2005 French feature by the highly uneven Francois Ozon (Swimming Pool, Under the Sand), who doesn't have much to say about his subject that's fresh.</snippet>

         <snippet>This oddly dispassionate film about a young man dying of cancer is the French antidote to those Hollywood weepies in which the heroine courageously faces her own mortality with every hair in place.</snippet>
