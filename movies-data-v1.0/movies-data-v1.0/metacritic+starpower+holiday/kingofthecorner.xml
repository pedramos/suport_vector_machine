         <snippet>King of the Corner is not plot-driven. It's like life: just one damned thing after another</snippet>

         <snippet>A witty and wise midlife comedy, not only represents Peter Riegert's debut as a feature director but gives this gifted veteran performer his juiciest big-screen role in quite some time.</snippet>

         <snippet>A warm, unexpectedly moving portrait of a man on the verge of what could either be a dreadful or delightful second chapter.</snippet>

         <snippet>The mild but affable story of an ad man's midlife crisis, King of the Corner is an actor's film in every way.</snippet>

         <snippet>Moments of this film reminded me of Alexander Payne's great library of male dysfunction -- "Election," "About Schmidt," "Sideways" -- not because King of the Corner actually reaches Payne's plane, but because I wish it had tried.</snippet>

         <snippet>Riegert and his cowriter, Gerald Shapiro, breathe some fresh air into the material with their credible characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>I've never quite figured out what the poker-faced Peter Riegert does as an actor, but his matter-of-fact minimalism is always funny and affecting.</snippet>

         <snippet>Warm and wise comedy of middle-age malaise.</snippet>

         <snippet>An average film starring an average character actor, but maybe that's the point. This is a story about the benefits of just showing up. Even at its most sentimental, Riegert's pet project possesses a lived-in integrity that nearly offsets the staleness of the material.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lacks the stylistic attention to psychological distress that might have lent it maximum impact. Instead, the pic is amiable, kinda charming, visually routine, and incisive in individual sequences.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's all pleasant but fairly unimportant, and then -- POW -- comes the great scene, almost out of nowhere.</snippet>

         <snippet>King of the Corner has been adapted from Gerald Shapiro's "Bad Jews and Other Stories" and suffers from an odd, disjointed quality.</snippet>

         <snippet>Peter Riegert's is a labor of love film where you feel love much stronger than you feel the film.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a low-key actor's showreel, harmless and toothless and sleepy. It'd go pretty well with a glass of warm milk.</snippet>

         <snippet>But look up the word "slight" in the dictionary and you could find a still from this film.</snippet>
