         <snippet>At a lean - and decidedly mean - 77 minutes, the suspense-horror hybrid Them by French writer-directors David Moreau and Xavier Palud is nothing short of revelatory.</snippet>

         <snippet>Eschewing special effects, Moreau and Palud reinvigorate the classic haunted house premise by paring the plot down to its essentials.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of the most intelligent and unnerving horror films in recent memory.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's no time wasted and no showy effects to detract from the situation -- just sheer tension.</snippet>

         <snippet>A welcome change from horror movies like "Hostel' and "Saw" and their mind-numbing gore and violence.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is scarier if you know nothing about it going in. It has no larger agenda. It’s not an allegory, a satire or a commentary. It’s just a modestly relentless suspense picture that propels its characters through a series of dreamscapes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Them is surprisingly tight, efficient and economical, conjuring a super-creepy atmosphere and incredible tension seemingly out of nothing at all.</snippet>

         <snippet>The characters in Them are paper-thin: They're mere props to be manipulated by co-directors David Moreau and Xavier Palud, who want nothing more than to scare you sh--less in what, with its nonstop chase sequences and booby traps, often comes off as a live-action video game.</snippet>

         <snippet>You'd better deliver the goods. And Them, despite some moody imagery out of the "Blair Witch" school, never does.</snippet>

         <snippet>The ending underscores the old cliche about the banality of evil but getting there is meant to be the whole fun. For some people at least.</snippet>

         <snippet>Them knows something the makers of the "Hostel" and "Saw" movies apparently don't: Subtlety and suggestion are every bit as terrifying as slashing and sawing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Technique is all you have to admire. There's nothing underneath the formal exercise. The film's coyness about what's happening is cheap.</snippet>

         <snippet>For a while, it works, until it suddenly decides to abandon the "what you don't see is scarier than what you do see" for a ridiculous and ultimately insulting explanatory ending.</snippet>
