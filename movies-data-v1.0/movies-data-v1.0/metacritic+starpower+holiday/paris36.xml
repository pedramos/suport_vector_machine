         <snippet>A gleaming hunk of French period schmaltz expertly rendered by director Christophe Barratier.</snippet>

         <snippet>Paris 36 has a beguilingly authentic sound and offers a blend of impassioned sentiment and harsh, even brutal grit</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is deliberately old-fashioned in its approach; the story line is resolutely linear and the production values are deluxe. It all makes for a fairly enjoyable, if schematic, backstage extravaganza.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's pleasant and amusing. If I had seen it before I was born, I would have loved it.</snippet>

         <snippet>The nicest that can be said of this unapologetically schmaltzy, and not unenjoyable, affair is that it is the best 1936 musical made in 2009.</snippet>

         <snippet>Barratier directs with a jaunty artifice more typically seen on stage, but with the exception of Arnezeder, his cast turns theatricality to its advantage. They're offering us a sunny fantasy during a cloudy time, and seem well aware that we're unlikely to resist.</snippet>

         <snippet>Politics and art come together in predictable, moderately enjoyable fashion in Paris 36.</snippet>

         <snippet>A little like spending the holidays with strangers. The spirits are high, the relationships are warm, the personal stories have a shared history, and even though you're on the outside of things, you appreciate the people in a remote and perhaps admiring sort of way. Still, when it's time to leave, you're not sorry.</snippet>

         <snippet>The overstuffed film lumbers across clichés of the heart and of history until it reaches a big, tune-filled climax that isn't worth the wait.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hopelessly amateurish, the troupe is saved by a remarkably pretty young blonde called Douce with a sweet soprano to match her angel face. The gifted, unknown actress-singer who plays her, Nora Arnezeder, also saves the movie, which would otherwise blur into a mass of droopy, mustached, big-honkered Gallic character actors.</snippet>

         <snippet>Schematically scripted tale revels in its multiple story arcs, but shows signs of battle fatigue in the later reels.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is almost rescued by the wonderful 1930's style songs (written by Reinhardt Wanger and Frank Thomas) that populate its final act.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like Amélie's scrubbed-up "City of Lights," Paris 36 is an antiseptic arthouse trifle, so eager to soothe that it only numbs.</snippet>

         <snippet>So shameless in its pandering, sentimental vision of Frenchness as to constitute something of a national embarrassment.</snippet>
