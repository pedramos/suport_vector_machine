         <snippet>In D.J. Caruso's Two for the Money, you can see Al Pacino doing something he's done a lot lately: Having a terrific time being an actor.</snippet>

         <snippet>Too long by about 20 minutes, and takes itself too seriously near the end. But if you're looking for a movie for a boys' night
out, it's a winner.</snippet>

         <snippet>For all its swaggering bravado, Pacino's turn in Two For The Money is the reverse image of his "Devil's Advocate" character: Instead of the omniscient, all-powerful operator he presents himself as, he's a gambler grasping at a lifestyle that's always just beyond his means.</snippet>

         <snippet>While it's focused on the people -- on men who never had mentors struggling to mentor themselves and each other -- the movie works as a smart B film.</snippet>

         <snippet>Over the years, Pacino's Method has become his madness, and now, whether he's playing Shylock or Satan, he doesn't become the part so much as the part becomes him.</snippet>

         <snippet>A sloppy and ridiculous movie that Pacino makes oddly entertaining.</snippet>

         <snippet>Marginally worth seeing if you're a Pacino fan but, even then, waiting for the DVD is the smart bet.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a compelling drama, if only a little hollow. For my money, Pacino's bark is ultimately better than Two For the Money's bite.</snippet>

         <snippet>It says in the beginning of the film that Two for the Money is "inspired by a true story." Problem is, it's just not that inspired.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has its rollicking moments and snappy lines but even Pacino can't elevate them into more than a fleetingly juicy treat. This is a movie that desperately wishes it had been written by David Mamet.</snippet>

         <snippet>It never quite adds up to anything. It's engaging enough while it's going on, but has little visceral impact or resonance.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sports betting is a great subject for a movie, but Two for the Money is short on the number-crunching nitty-gritty.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dramatic failings are only exacerbated by D.J. Caruso's direction: He composes every frame as if for television -- despite the fact that the film is shot in widescreen -- and his visual style is about as cinematic as sports talk radio.</snippet>

         <snippet>A confusion of tones, intentions and allusions, Two for the Money lurches from upbeat to downbeat without ever settling into a coherent groove.</snippet>

         <snippet>Pure, unself-conscious macho camp, but it's not like Pacino and McConaughey don't know it. They're pitching tents and romping around in the grass like Jerry Maguire on steroids.</snippet>

         <snippet>Pacino is a one-man three-ring circus, blustering, capering, cursing, raging and weaseling his way through this predictable morality play like a trickster Satan on speed.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you expect anything more substantive from a movie - characters of more than one dimension, storylines that at the least play new riffs on old themes, plot developments that flow from the narrative - you'd best look elsewhere.</snippet>

         <snippet>In keeping with his apparent ambition to play each character more berserk than the last, Pacino can't discuss wine choice without sounding on the brink of aneurysm.</snippet>

         <snippet>The direction by Caruso adds little to the dynamics, although the script by Dan Gilroy offers the occasional gem. Nevertheless, Two for the Money is hardly a cineplex bargain.</snippet>

         <snippet>Two for the Money, which was written by Dan Gilroy (Freejack, Chasers), is so badly constructed and illogical that its inanities manage to drown the actor (Pacino) out.</snippet>
