         <snippet>This is a movie for all cultures and all people, for families and especially for those who have lost them.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a masterful little film, and, thanks to Zhang's seasoned hands, it's subtly heartfelt but never manipulative.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ken Takakura, a great rain-creased oak of an actor, delivers a quietly massive performance.</snippet>

         <snippet>This new picture will reach only a few devoted American spectators. That's too bad, because once you get used to the apparent flatness and emotional reserve of this picture, it's a sad, slyly comic tale of family trauma and reconciliation that packs a wallop.</snippet>

         <snippet>Turning away from his highly entertaining epics "Hero" and "House of Flying Daggers," Zhang Yimou goes for utter simplicity in Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles, a film of much distilled wit and wisdom.</snippet>

         <snippet>Zhang's film is sweet and sentimental nearly to a fault; luckily, he's such a master, you'll hardly notice how shamelessly you're being manipulated.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although "Riding" is a small-scale movie as opposed to a big-scale epic, it is just as ambitious.</snippet>

         <snippet>Zhang is a master of detail and spectacle. There is also plenty of comedy, particularly in the scenes with linguistically challenged translators.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a film that can leave you on the fence. There's great facility with non-pro actors, with unusual locations, with both intimate and epic-scale scenes. Yet at the same time, Takata's reserve overwhelms the picture and makes its efforts to elicit emotions seem clumsy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cynics may not fall for its melodrama, but Riding Alone is good for everyone else, including children.</snippet>

         <snippet>Embedded here in a culture of formalities, with some of the arcs and gestures of that culture, it almost becomes an opera of its own.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unlikely to be ranked as one of Zhang's greatest accomplishments but is clearly the work of a major filmmaker. It is best seen as a heartfelt tribute to Takakura, as heroic and enduring a star as John Wayne.</snippet>

         <snippet>A simple, low-budget, contempo dramedy -- with plenty of clever plot reversals.</snippet>

         <snippet>A little uncanny (has it been digitally manipulated?) and a whole lot clich√©d, the tableau speaks of melancholy graced by a pale sliver of hope. You'd roll your eyes if they weren't so dazzled.</snippet>

         <snippet>Slow and pretty and duller than you'd hope for from an art-house sophisticate like Zhang.</snippet>

         <snippet>Riding Alone features a moving performance by Takakura (often called the Asian Clint Eastwood), as well as pretty cinematography. But the mushy script, co-written by Zhang, never rises above that of a TV soap opera.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is not storytelling by a confident artist. Even Zhang's former mastery of visual form has become shaky, with a pedestrian handling of dramatic scenes and a surfeit of picture-postcard landscape shots.</snippet>

         <snippet>Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou has created so many memorable films (most recently the wuxia double-play "Hero" and "House of Flying Daggers") that one can easily excuse his new clinker Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles.</snippet>
