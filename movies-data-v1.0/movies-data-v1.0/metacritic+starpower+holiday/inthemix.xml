         <snippet>A one-dimensional romantic comedy that  feels like an old-fashioned vehicle picture, the kind the big movie studios used to make in the 1930's and 40's just to bring in the fans of a particular actor or actress.</snippet>

         <snippet>A pleasantly tuned vehicle for R&amp;B star and budding actor Usher.</snippet>

         <snippet>All Usher fans really seem to want out of a movie like this is an opportunity to ogle their idol for an hour and a half. And that's all this movie affords them.</snippet>

         <snippet>A genially cruddy B movie can sometimes go places - sort of - that bigger movies won't.</snippet>

         <snippet>All of the plot developments seem half-hearted -- which is a shame, because the star has the charm to succeed if given a better movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>That the 27-year-old Usher isn't much of an actor is no surprise, but he's strikingly uncharismatic for someone who's been in the spotlight since he was six.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie pitches itself as a modern-day "Romeo and Juliet," but its execution is so lazy and inept that if the lovers were to die horribly it would come more as relief than tragedy. Sadly, in this respect, as in every other, In the Mix disappoints.</snippet>

         <snippet>Platinum-selling singer Usher is one hell of a clotheshorse, but he's too amiable to be convincing as a leading man--not that anyone is particularly believable in this feeble comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>A jumble of genres including mob melodrama, bodyguard romance and interracial love story, none of which is handled in a remotely satisfying manner by director Ron Underwood. The film's tone shifts with all the grace of a car with a balky transmission.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even diehard fans will get more out of watching a four-minute music video
than they'll find in this mixed-up mess.</snippet>

         <snippet>May be a good tactical move for the artist's career, but it's a bad movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>This vehicle for hip-hop star Usher is no blinged-out Beamer rough-riding it over to Jay-Z's joint to wallop some cheeba up off'n the Zeezer's haid; it's more of a Yugo, as in "You go to this wannabe straight-to-video tripe, you deserve what you get."</snippet>
