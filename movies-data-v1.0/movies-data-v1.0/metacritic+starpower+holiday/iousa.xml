         <snippet>It accomplishes an amazing thing. It explains the national debt, the foreign trade deficit, the decrease in personal savings, how the prime interest rate works, and the weakness of our leaders.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's no quick fix for a culture "addicted to debt," as one wag puts it in the film. But watching I.O.U.S.A. is a good place to start.</snippet>

         <snippet>They deliver a clear and compelling primer on the federal budget deficit, the trade deficit, and the personal debt crisis, all of which are driving our country toward a catastrophic financial meltdown.</snippet>

         <snippet>This smartly assembled wake-up call concerning the nation's lousy spending habits proves to be as unexpectedly spirited as it is dispiriting.</snippet>

         <snippet>Packed with facts, figures and the testimony of policy experts, the film is no wallow in wonkiness, though, but a surprisingly sprightly tough-love lesson in fiscal responsibility.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though the filmmaking is playful at times, the film is essentially 90 percent message, 10 percent movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perhaps, like Al Gore's lecture on global warming, the force of its argument will stir some of those who see it to further research the subject.</snippet>

         <snippet>There is a difference between the importance of a film's subject and the quality of a film's execution. And the execution is lacking. The film just isn't, well, very interesting.</snippet>

         <snippet>One graphic that I.O.U.S.A. doesn't include is a national balance sheet of our assets and liabilities, which would illustrate that the former is more than double the latter. We're in the black, and a film this deep in the red isn't something to be scared of at all -- or taken seriously.</snippet>
