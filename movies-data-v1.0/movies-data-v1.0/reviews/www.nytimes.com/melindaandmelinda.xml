      <text>he new Woody Allen movie, "Melinda and Melinda," is framed, somewhat in the manner of "Broadway Danny Rose," by table talk. Lingering over dinner at Pastis, four marvelously articulate New Yorkers debate the interpretation of an anecdote, unheard by the audience, involving an unhappy young woman named Melinda. Two of the diners happen to be playwrights - perhaps the only two left in New York who could afford to eat at such a restaurant, but never mind - and one of them, a maker of serious dramas (Larry Pine) sees the story as a tragedy, while the other, a cherubic author of comedies (Wallace Shawn), claims it for his own preferred genre. That the tragedian turns out to have a sunnier view of life than his colleague is part of the film's point: in life and in art, funny often keeps close company with sad, to the extent that it is sometimes hard to distinguish one from the other. Mr. Allen does not make it much easier. As he interweaves two versions of the Melinda story, one meant to be bathed in pathos, the other sprinkled with whimsy, it becomes apparent that his notions of comedy and tragedy do not quite correspond either to scholarly dogma or to everyday usage. You might, for instance, expect the tragic tale to purge your unruly emotions through pity and terror, rather than through bafflement and ennui. You might also expect the comic half of the movie to be funny, in which case the joke is on you. The link between the two asymmetrical stories is Radha Mitchell, who plays Melinda in both, surrounded in each case by a different supporting cast. The distinction between comedy and tragedy comes down, ultimately, to her: if she is wild-haired, fretfully smoking and overacting like a contestant in the Jennifer Jason Leigh category on "American Idol," then it must be tragedy. If, on the other hand, her hair is neatly bobbed and her manner ingenue-fresh, then comedy is the name of the game. In both renderings, she crashes a dinner party with an air of distress and a tale of woe, and her arrival sets off a chain of marital misunderstanding and emotional collision that swirls through subsequent parties and further dinners in charming Manhattan restaurants. The tragic Melinda barges in on some old friends - Laurel (Chloï¿½ Sevigny), a Park Avenue trust-fund baby, and her husband, Lee (Jonny Lee Miller), an intermittently employed actor with a bit of a drinking problem. This Melinda arrives demanding single malt Scotch and brandishing a florid life story that includes a bitter divorce, an unhappy love affair and a suicide attempt. (An even darker chapter is revealed later on.) Her comic counterpart, whose misery is less Gothic, lives downstairs from another couple, an intermittently employed actor named Hobie (Will Ferrell) and his wife, Susan (Amanda Peet), an independent filmmaker. In both scenarios, Melinda's presence stirs up latent instabilities within her friends' marriages and causes some upheaval in their social and professional lives. Not that the two plots are exactly parallel, though they are connected by ingeniously placed details and motifs. In the comedy, Hobie falls in love with Melinda, while in the tragedy she and Laurel become rivals for the affections of a gallant pianist and composer with the extraordinary name of Ellis Moonsong, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor ("Love, Actually," "Dirty Pretty Things"). Mr. Ejiofor's presence, along with that of Daniel Sunjata in a smaller, similar role in the film's comic half, is perhaps the biggest shock in "Melinda and Melinda." In the fifth decade of his career as a New York filmmaker, Mr. Allen has written not one but two black characters into a movie, without sensationalism or stereotyping. Better late than never, I suppose. In every other respect, though, Mr. Allen's Manhattan remains a fantasy world, which is both a serious limitation and a minor source of delight. By now, there is nothing to be gained from complaining about the inaccuracies and anachronisms that color his view of the city or the strange, stilted idioms its inhabitants use in his films. It is better to appreciate him as a kind of preservationist, carefully restoring a cultural niche where the hectic elegance of old studio comedies and serious Broadway plays might still flourish amid the vulgar madcap of the 21st-century metropolis. "Melinda and Melinda" is perhaps best thought of as an offering to the memories of Ernst Lubitsch and George S. Kaufman, half-forgotten culture heroes whose examples of crisp sophistication deserve to be kept alive for future generations. Mr. Allen pries his actors away from their naturalistic habits, evoking a pre-Method style of performance that has all but vanished from the modern stage and screen. The results are mixed. Ms. Sevigny, Mr. Ejiofor and Ms. Peet seem liberated, freed of the necessity to plumb psychological depths and able to explore behavior rather than motive. Mr. Miller, struggling with an underwritten part and a badly fitting accent, has a harder time, as does Mr. Ferrell, who is miscast in the Woody Allen surrogate role of soulful schlemiel. Mr. Ferrell, with his large, shambling body and bland features, is hardly the ideal mouthpiece for the jittery, hostile one-liners that afflict Mr. Allen's writing like a tic. Coming into a pretentiously decorated vacation house in the Hamptons, Mr. Ferrell seems much more likely to trip over the furniture than to insult it, and Mr. Allen grudgingly allows him a single moment of physical comedy, involving a bathrobe that gets stuck in a door. Which brings me to the real reason to appreciate Mr. Allen, which is as an unrivaled pornographer. I'm not talking about sex; there is some bed-hopping in "Melinda and Melinda," but the camera always stops at the bedroom door. These days, in any case, the kind of New Yorkers likely to see a Woody Allen movie reserve their true lust for real estate, and the long hallways, high ceilings and open kitchens on display in this movie are likely to keep local audiences sighing and moaning for the full 99 minutes. To make the fantasy even more delicious and indecent, these apartments are inhabited by struggling actors, filmmakers and musicians who amusingly complain about being broke when the combined market value of their property could finance another installation of "The Gates." Which is, come to think of it, both funny and sad. "Melinda and Melinda" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has many sexual references and situations, and some off-color language.</text>
