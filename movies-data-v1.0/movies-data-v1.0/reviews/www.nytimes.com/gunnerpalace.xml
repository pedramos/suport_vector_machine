      <text>he title of "Gunner Palace," a vivid and hectic documentary directed by Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein, refers to a monstrous pleasure dome in the Baghdad neighborhood of Adhamiya that once belonged to Uday Hussein, one of the rotten princelings of the old regime. Its opulence somewhat reduced by American bombs, the building now serves as a barracks for American soldiers, who make use of its swimming pool and putting green when they are not patrolling the dangerous streets of the Iraqi capital, raiding the homes of suspected terrorists and trying to juggle the complicated, hazardous duties of occupation. Mr. Tucker, an American who makes his home in Germany, spent several months in late 2003 and early 2004 unofficially embedded with the United States Army's 2-3 Field Artillery Division (known as the Gunners) in the palace. The resulting film is an unruly, riveting assemblage of anecdotes and impressions. The larger political and military questions about the war in Iraq are kept deliberately in the background, which some viewers may find frustrating. "Gunner Palace" does not present a clear or coherent point of view of why or how the war has been fought, but this limitation is also a virtue. Clarity and certainty, the movie suggests, are luxuries that come with distance and hindsight. What the soldiers have to deal with from day to day is far more chaotic and changeable, so it makes  sense that chaos should be not only  the filmmakers' subject but also a crucial aspect of their method. Early on, Mr. Tucker invokes reality television to emphasize the contrast between such manufactured spectacles as "Survivor" and the real business of surviving, but "Gunner Palace" owes as much of a debt to small-screen v�rit� as it does to the loftier traditions of nonfiction cinema. It's hard not to see jerky, breathless hand-held images of armed men in uniform cruising through rough neighborhoods without thinking of "Cops," or to witness young Americans hanging out in their shared quarters, accoutered with headphones, laptops and other high-tech accessories, without being reminded of "The Real World." Perhaps inadvertently, Mr. Tucker and Ms. Epperlein have glimpsed Iraq through the lens of American popular culture, and their film is also a mirror, reflecting back into that culture an image of itself at once utterly alien and entirely familiar. Mr. Tucker's occasional voice-over narration is deliberately flat and prosaic. The rough poetry that his video camera captured belongs to the setting - a landscape that is bright, teeming and tense by day, eerie and murky by night - and to the soldiers, several of whom are talented free-style rappers and spoken-word declaimers. Their rhymes and beats punctuate the film and provide it with a dense, dizzying eloquence. But even soldiers with plainer verbal styles and different modes of expression manage to stamp their experiences with something of their own personalities. The older officers speak in world-weary bureaucratese, their professionalism tinged with both cynicism and pride. The unit's designated cut-up, a round-faced soldier from Colorado who seems alternately sensitive and sociopathic, strums his electric guitar and cracks jokes. One young man speaks excitedly of the thrill of combat, while another muses that nothing is ever improved by the taking of a life. In refusing to generalize or to judge, "Gunner Palace" opens itself up to varying interpretations, all of them likely to be colored by the interpreter's prior opinions about the war. The soldiers' irreverent humor, and the efficient brutality with which they break into Iraqi homes in their hunt for "bad guys," may suggest a prelude to the abuse at Abu Ghraib (which is where, we are told, many of those arrested will go). The scene of an American officer, who speaks no Arabic, trying to moderate a raucous neighborhood council meeting, reveals both the absurd challenge of imposing democracy on Iraq and also the patience, seriousness and goodwill it requires. The interactions between Iraqis and the Americans suggest a mutual ambivalence - a desire for some kind of constructive relationship that coexists with suspicion, incomprehension and sometimes contempt. Iraq and the United States are both societies full of contradiction, and to watch "Gunner Palace" is to see the contradictions multiply. And not only on screen. I have now seen it twice - the first time last fall, at the Toronto Film Festival, with the American presidential election on the horizon, and the second time not long after the Iraqi elections this past January - and each time my reaction was colored by events outside the theater. In that sense, the movie, like the war that it partly chronicles, remains unfinished, to be completed - or further complicated - in the public arguments and private reflections of its audience. For every viewer who finds the film's portrayal of the troops troublingly unsympathetic, there will be another who finds it insufficiently critical. But this says more about the audience than about the film, which respects the humanity of its subjects by regarding them with a mixture of admiration, puzzlement and worry, and mostly by listening to what they have to say, even when they contradict themselves. The raw inconclusiveness of "Gunner Palace" is the truest measure of its authenticity as an artifact of our time and of its value for future attempts to understand what the United States is doing in Iraq. Over the last few years, we have been subjected to an awful lot of certainty - from proponents of the war, from its critics and even from vacillators and equivocators. "Gunner Palace," in its savage, intelligent, boisterous messiness, is a welcome antidote to the self-convinced rhetoric of pundits and politicians. Each time I have seen it, I have emerged feeling moved, angry, scared, hopeful, frustrated and dispirited - and grateful for this confusion, which is its own form of understanding. This film is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has strong language and violent scenes.</text>
