      <text>'CELEBRATE BROOKLYN !'   Prospect Park  Bandshell, 9th Street and Prospect Park West, Brooklyn, 718-855-7882, celebratebrooklyn.org
July 8 PRODIGAL SON  (Sammo Hung, 1982) With DJ IXL and DJ Excess scratching an original score.
July 21 PHANTOM OF THE OPERA  (Rupert Julian , 1925) Live score by the Alloy Orchestra . Still the only version of Gaston Leroux 's Gothic-lit romance worth watching, thanks to silent film's primitive likeness to the historical silliness of the story and Lon Chaney 's Herculean achievements in self-torture. ATKINSON
July 29 THE SOUND OF MUSIC  (Robert Wise , 1965)
August 4 TARZAN THE APE MAN  (W.S. Van Dyke , 1932) Live score by Mocean Worker .

'MOVIES UNDER THE STARS'    Pier A Park, 1st Street and Sinatra Drive, Hoboken , New Jersey, 201-420-2207
June 1 GARDEN STATE  (Zach Braff , 2004) Best-known for his role as a retarded quarterback, anhedonic actor-waiter Andrew "Large" Largeman (Zach Braff) comes home to New Jersey for his mom's funeral. Why hasn't he spoken to his folks in nine years&#151;and what's with all the mood stabilizers? Braff's triple threat has a patient way with information. The tragic backstory fills in gradually, and the slow reveal feels accurate rather than merely suspenseful. Then there are the goofier, permanent gaps: After an evening of detached debauchery, Large finds "BALLS" inexplicably Magic Markered on his forehead. PARK
June 8 BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON (Beeban Kidron, 2004)
June 15 SUPER SIZE ME  (Morgan Spurlock , 2004) Appetite suppressant, frat boy stunt, and anti-corporate head butt, Spurlock's self-starring documentary records the amusingly horrifying consequences of the director's 30-day McDonald's-only diet. The film, which exerts the gross-out fascination of reality TV's muckier specimens, has nothing new to say about America's fast-food addiction and obesity epidemic, but there's no denying its grotesque effectiveness as a work of public health advocacy. Fighting grease with grease, it's a film that has its severely taxed heart in the right place. LIM
June 22 HOTEL RWANDA (Terry George , 2004)
June 29 THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES  (Walter Salles , 2004)
July 6 SPIDERMAN 2  (Sam Raimi , 2004)
July 13  THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA  (Joel Schumacher , 2004)
July 20 MILLION DOLLAR BABY  (Clint Eastwood , 2004)
July 27 THE AVIATOR (Martin Scorsese , 2004) Scorsese, our foremost moviemaking cinephile, cannonballs into old Hollywood  to tell the story of one Howard Hughes , billionaire, briber, star fucker, plane crasher, occasional movie producer, and all-around neurotic shit storm. Gigantic, blustery, and stuffed with cameoed details (Cate Blanchett 's riff on Katharine Hepburn  makes her the dead legend's avatar), it's a biopic paradigm&#151;and an American-dream-gone-rancid tale bidding to complement Raging Bull . ATKINSON
August 3 FINDING NEVERLAND  (Marc Forster , 2004) Johnny Depp  gives an unusually subdued performance as J.M. Barrie , who in befriending a young widow (Kate Winslet ) and her four sons, received the inspiration for his 1905 play Peter Pan  . Inhabiting a green, empty England in endless Edwardian summer, Marc Forster's first film since Monster's Ball  raises all manner of red flags with its surfeit of loaded themes&#151;beatifying illness, bereft children, escapist fantasy, the enshrining of boyhood&#151;but overall practices a tasteful restraint. WINTER
August 10 HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN  (Alfonso Cuarón , 2004)
August 17 SHARK TALE  (Bibo Bergeron , Vickey Jenson  &amp; Rob Letterman , 2004)
August 24 SHREK 2  (Andrew Adamson , Kelly Asbury  &amp; Conrad Vernon , 2004)
August 31 ROBOTS  (Chris Wedge  &amp; Carlos Saldanha , 2005)

'RIVER FLICKS'   July 6-August 26, Pier 54, West 13th Street and West Side Highway; and Pier 25, North Moore Street and West Side Highway, 212-533-PARK, hudsonriverpark.org
PIER 54
July 6 SLACKERS  (Dewey Nicks , 2002)
July 13 BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE  (Stephen Herek , 1989)
July 20 THE BIG LEBOWSKI (Joel Coen , 1998) Perfectly stylized and pleasingly discombobulated, this Coen brothers  jape is rich with comic cameos, albeit drawing heavily on Jeff Bridges 's charm as a Kahlúa-swilling old hippie introduced shopping for munchies in a flannel bathrobe. The Big Lebowski intermittently references The Big Sleep  but this wacky series of L.A. adventures featuring a stoned slacker as a surrogate Philip Marlowe  is pure pop rumination&#151;so relaxed as to be nearly free-associative. HOBERMAN
July 27 UP IN SMOKE (Lou Adler, 1978)
August 3 CLERKS  (Kevin Smith , 1994)
August 10 ANIMAL HOUSE  (John Landis , 1978)
August 17 FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH  (Cameron Crowe , 1982) The seminal, over-fondly-remembered brat pack fave, notable today only as Sean Penn 's first big blip on the cultural scan, and for Phoebe Cates 's generation-traumatizing nude scene. ATKINSON
August 24 DAZED AND CONFUSED  (Richard Linklater , 1993) No less structuralist than Slacker &#151;expressing a fierce muddle of memories rather than a rambling paranoia&#151;this mini-masterpiece about 1970s Texas high school kids inhabiting their self-defined universe is one of the most rewatchable films of its decade, capturing its time and place with anthropological care. ATKINSON

PIER 25
July 8 DADDY DAY CARE  (Steve Carr , 2003)
July 15 WILLY WONKA &amp; THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY  (Mel Stuart , 1971)
July 22 BACK TO THE FUTURE  (Robert Zemeckis , 1985)
July 29 THE SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS MOVIE  (Stephen Hillenburg , 2004) No Pixar ? No problem! An unstoppable good-mood generator, this resolutely 2-D vehicle has more yuks than Shark Tale  and enough soul to swallow The Polar Express  whole. It's a kids' movie that deigns to understand what kids want to see&#151;hysterical amplifications of kid-like behavior and the making fun of oldsters, rather than the pop-cult winking and cruddy nostalgia that said oldsters presumably favor. To wit: When King Neptune (Jeffrey Tambor ) discloses his shiny pate, onlookers shriek, "Bald! Bald!" and "My eyes!" PARK
August 5 ELLA ENCHANTED  (Tommy O'Haver , 2004)
