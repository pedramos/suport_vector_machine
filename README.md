Somewhere in this code is Elastic Net, Lasso and Ridge Regression to predict values based on text.

[ UNDER MAINTENANCE ] Cleanup is needed

Anyway, I think iteracoes.py have the "engine" for some models and Lasso.py, elastic_net.py, Rgrad.py and Rfechado.py have the models

The Priberam_* scripts are only an interface for a set of data (data is not public and I don't have it anymore). On the "engine's" scripts there are also interfaces for movie's data (in the repositorie).
